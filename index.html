    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p style="width: 50%;">
            I'm Caspian, a 26 year old from <strong>Malmö, Sweden</strong>. I've spent the last 10 years 
            learning as much as I can about marketing and media production. Right now
            I'm making a pivot to development, wanting to find creative ways to solve problems 
            I've seen clients and colleagues have in the past!

            <p>
                I've been running my own consultancy firm since 2018. The first three years, 
                I was full time freelancing after which I've been running it as a side-hustle.
                Among other things, I produced podcasts, ran and grew multiple SoMe accounts,
                created brand-books, coached, and did data managament in Airtable.

        <h3>Refined Wiki — Sep - Dec 2023 — Product marketing specialist</h3>
            <p>
                I was hired as a copywriter, the main focus being writing blog-posts for the self-hosted blog.
                I was only on the team for about 3 months, as the role didn't really fit. 
                I learned a lot during my time at Refined though, such as selling to 
                a confined platform, writing for a SaaS-business, writing better texts,
                writing compelling marketing emails, and SoMe management for a bigger company.
